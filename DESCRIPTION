Description: Provides function to fit a semiparametric proportional odds model 
  for arbitrarily censored and left-truncated survival data. The baseline 
  odds function is modeled using integrated B-spline (I-spline) basis 
  functions. Model fitting is performed via an EM algorithm. Plots 
  of the baseline survival, hazard, and odds functions are included.
